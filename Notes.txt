MAIN AIM OF PYTHON LANGUAGE IS THE CODE IS MORE READ RATHER THAN WRITTEN.
MAKE THE CODE MORE READABLE
####################################

Python is versatile language and powerfull high-level language
The Basic Syntax for automatic compiling is 
            !# usr/bin/env python
It automatically provide the path to compiler the script is executed automatically.

Strings can also be considered as an array in python.

eg: 

word = 'abc'
output
    word[0] = a

new_word = 'd' +  word[1:] #It specifies the range.
output:
    dbc

Unicode can be used as a new method/way for storing the text data. It provides the
way for providing the internationalization of the product/software/web etc.

Most important point:
    ----> Strings are the immutable objects i.e Strings values cannot be changed.

List v/s Tuples
    Tuples are fixed in size i.e is immutable and list is mutable i.e dynamic.
    Values in the tuple cannot be removed nor added it do not have add(), append(),
    pop(), remove() method.
    
    To find the elements in tuple u can in operator to check if an element exists.
    Tuples can be used as an dictionary. List cannot be used as Dictionary.
          
Fundatmental Difference between the List and Tuple is:
    List->Homoegenious in Nature i.e they maintain order.
    Tuple -> Heterogeneous in Nature i.e they maintain structure.

List internals
    It acts as a sequence 
    

    Basic syntax for list is 
    list[1,2,3,4,5]

    For slicing we use the following syntax

    list[1:3]

Range Function:
    Can be used to Iterate over the sequence of number. But if we want to interate 
    over more than one variable or even if we don't the enumerate method is the most
    convinient way to iterate over the loop.

for - else statement:
    Its similar to go-to statements in C/C++. The else loop will be executed only
and only if the iterable i.e for/while loop has completely executed. Generally it
is used for finding the searchable item. If the desired key is found in iterable 
function we can use break statemet for that. While iterating if we break the itera
-ble loop the else statement is not gonna be executed.

Generally the syntax is read as.
FIND SOME ITEMS IN ITERABLE , ELSE IF NONE WAS FOUND DO SOMTHING ..

This syntax can be used for while, try statements.

Continue statement is similar to the continue used in C.
It generaly tends to improve the readability of the code. It reduces the level of
indentation required may be in if not <condition>.

Details on List Command

insert(i,x)
    i = Position     x = item
append(x)
    insert item at the end of list.

remove(x)
    remove the first item 'x' from the list.

index(x)
    returns the position of item 'x' in the list.

count(x)
    Returns the no of times the elements has occured in the list.

reverse()
    reverse the elements in list.
 sort(cmp=None, key=None, reverse =false)

    insert(),remove(),sort() do not return any value they always return NONE. Its a 
design principle for all mutable data structures.
