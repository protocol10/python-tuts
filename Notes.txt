Python is versatile language and powerfull high-level language
The Basic Syntax for automatic compiling is 
            !# usr/bin/env python
It automatically provide the path to compiler the script is executed automatically.

Strings can also be considered as an array in python.

eg: 

word = 'abc'
output
    word[0] = a

new_word = 'd' +  word[1:] #It specifies the range.
output:
    dbc

Unicode can be used as a new method/way for storing the text data. It provides the
way for providing the internationalization of the product/software/web etc.

Most important point:
    ----> Strings are the immutable objects i.e Strings values cannot be changed.

List v/s Tuples
    Tuples are fixed in size i.e is immutable and list is mutable i.e dynamic.
    Values in the tuple cannot be removed nor added it do not have add(), append(),
    pop(), remove() method.
    
    To find the elements in tuple u can in operator to check if an element exists.
    Tuples can be used as an dictionary. List cannot be used as Dictionary.
          
Fundatmental Difference between the List and Tuple is:
    List->Homoegenious in Nature i.e they maintain order.
    Tuple -> Heterogeneous in Nature i.e they maintain structure.
